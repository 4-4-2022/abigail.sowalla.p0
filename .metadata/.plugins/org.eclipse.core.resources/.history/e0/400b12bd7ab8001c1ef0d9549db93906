//Project 0 - "Fishy Friends Aquarium Shop - Supplying All Your Aquarium Needs"
/*
This is my project. It simulates an Aquarium shop. Users will be able to make an account with a username and password, have more than one account, add a secondary user to pick up orders, add a second user who can make orders, add funds, remove funds, transfer funds, browse the shop's catalog, and add items to a cart. Employees will be able to view account information (users, user info, funds) and cancel accounts. Admin employees should be able to modify account blances and user info.
